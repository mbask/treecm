\title{
Green wood density data for a few tree species
}
\description{
Wood density is used to convert wood volume measures in the field to their fresh weights. It is measured in \eqn{\frac{kg}{m^3}}.
}
\usage{data(Dst)}
\format{
A data frame with 161 observations on the following variable.
\describe{
  \item{\code{density}}{a numeric vector}
  }
}
\details{Density is measured at humidity level 50\%, very close to mean living tree wood humidity. The dataset is provided as a reference only, please be cautioned about using these values on your samples.
