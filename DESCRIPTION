Description: Given a few data about branchiness of a tree the package
    computes and plots the centre of mass of the tree itself. The
    centre of mass is a crucial data for arborists in order to
    consolidate a tree using steel or dynamic cables. Slenderness
    ratio of branches may also be assessed and plot in order to
    aid the pruning selection process
