1.2.1
Updated to ensure compatibility with recent ggplot2 releases
1.2
Updated to provide compatibility with R 3.0
1.1
Removed switchBranchPruningStatus as it can be expressed in a simple base statement
Added feature to estimate the force on a ground plinth needed to stabilize a tree with a static steel cable
Added stonePine2FieldData dataset
Changed name of dataset fieldData to stonePine1FieldData
Changed name of dataset treeData to stonePine1TreeData
1.0.4
Updated to R 2.15.0
Updated to roxygen2
Slight change to treeVectors and new dependency from plyr
Correctly declared S3 methods: plot.vector, plot.SR and summary.CM
New S3 generic method plot.CM to plot CM on top of a plot generated by plot.vector
CM is now a named list instead of a vector
New S3 generic method print.CM prints just the cartesian coordinates of CM
Improved Makefile
1.0.3
Added a new allometry fitting equation yielding stone pine fresh weight (allometryABDC) 
Density dataset now provides 50% moisture content densities for a whole variety of conifers and dicots: Niklas, K. J. & Spatz, H.-C. Worldwide correlations of mechanical properties and green wood density American Journal of Botany, 2010, 97, 1587-1594
1.0.2
New feature: slenderness ratio for branches is computed and plotted. Tree SR is defined as L/D according to Mattheck, C. and Breloer, H. Banches SR is corrected to take into account branch deviation from the verticality.
Minor tweaks and speed improvements
Fixed bug that prevented data import
1.01 
fieldData column dir renamed to azimuth
